# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a full-stack interactive application that analyzes and recommends option spreads for NIFTY and BANKNIFTY indices using real-time data from the Angel One API. The application will identify optimal Bull Call Spreads and Bear Put Spreads based on delta filtering criteria, providing users with actionable trading recommendations along with real-time market visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive real-time option spread recommendations for NIFTY and BANKNIFTY, so that I can identify profitable trading opportunities with optimal risk-reward ratios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches option chain data THEN it SHALL filter options based on delta criteria (buy leg: 0.15-0.26 delta ITM, sell leg: slightly lower delta ATM/OTM)
2. WHEN calculating spreads THEN the system SHALL prioritize Bull Call Spread and Bear Put Spread structures
3. WHEN multiple spreads are available THEN the system SHALL rank them by highest reward-to-risk ratio based on premium difference and strike distance
4. WHEN filtering options THEN the system SHALL use nearest weekly expiry options
5. WHEN returning recommendations THEN the system SHALL include buy/sell strikes, premiums, delta values, max profit/loss, and expiry date

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view real-time price charts for NIFTY and BANKNIFTY indices, so that I can make informed decisions about market timing for my option spreads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches market data THEN it SHALL retrieve 1-minute OHLC data for both NIFTY and BANKNIFTY
2. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL update data every 15 seconds automatically
3. WHEN rendering charts THEN the system SHALL overlay both indices on the same visualization using Plotly.js
4. WHEN charts are displayed THEN they SHALL be responsive and mobile-friendly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a secure and reliable backend API, so that I can access real-time market data without exposing sensitive credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL authenticate with Angel One SmartAPI using stored access tokens
2. WHEN API keys are stored THEN they SHALL be secured in environment variables via .env file
3. WHEN the system provides endpoints THEN it SHALL expose /recommendations and /chart-data endpoints
4. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN it SHALL be configured for Render hosting with proper requirements.txt and render.yaml
5. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and rate limiting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want an intuitive web interface, so that I can easily view spread recommendations and market charts in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL display top option spreads with clear profit/loss metrics
2. WHEN showing recommendations THEN the interface SHALL present data in an organized table or card format
3. WHEN displaying charts THEN they SHALL be integrated seamlessly with the recommendations view
4. WHEN the interface is accessed THEN it SHALL be responsive across desktop and mobile devices
5. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the application to be deployed and accessible online, so that I can access it from anywhere without local setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN it SHALL be hosted on Render with proper configuration
2. WHEN the frontend is deployed THEN it SHALL be hosted separately (Vercel) or served as static files from backend
3. WHEN the application is accessed THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
4. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL maintain 99% uptime during market hours
5. WHEN deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for environment setup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured codebase, so that I can maintain and extend the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL separate backend and frontend into distinct directories
2. WHEN backend code is organized THEN it SHALL have separate modules for API integration, spread logic, and chart data
3. WHEN frontend code is structured THEN it SHALL use component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use virtual environments for Python and package.json for Node.js
5. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow best practices for error handling, logging, and code documentation
